            <p class="aboutus_pg"> We are passionate people who love sports.</p>
            <p class="aboutus_pg"> We want to spread love and fun through sports.</p>
            <p class="aboutus_pg"> We are Wafic, George, and Omar. We came to love sports when we were in university 
                sepending our days playing table tennis. Since then, we wanted to open a table tennis cluc of our own, 
                for when we finish university, we can keep on practicing the sport. And that's how we came up with this club. 
                We later expanded to include other sports by building other stadiums in our complex, and we hope to expand 
                our facilities and members even more in the future.
